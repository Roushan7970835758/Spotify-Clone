# Spotify-Clone
This Spotify clone replicates the design and functionality of the original using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive layout, hover effects, play/pause functionality, and a seek bar, ensuring an immersive music streaming experience.

Using CSS, the design elements, including colors, typography, and layout, have been carefully replicated to match Spotify's aesthetic. Hover effects and smooth transitions enhance the user experience, providing a visually appealing and interactive interface.

JavaScript is responsible for implementing crucial features, such as play/pause functionality and a seek bar. These features allow users to control music playback and seek to specific positions within a track. Challenges encountered during development were addressed to maintain accurate functionality and seamless updates.

The project's responsiveness is achieved through responsive design principles and media queries. It adjusts flawlessly to different screen sizes, accommodating desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. With its intuitive design and compatibility across devices, the Spotify clone offers users an immersive and enjoyable music streaming experience.
